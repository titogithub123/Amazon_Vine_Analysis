# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to confirm whether or not there is a bias between the paid and non-paid Amazon Vine and non-Vine memebers when they offer a review of a product offered on Amazon's website. 

## Results
By means of the analysis we hope to answer the following questions...

1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine review were 5 stars?
3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-vine reviews were 5 stars?

Taking a look at the data we can see the difference in the number of Vine reviews vs. non-Vine reviews. First let's take a look and see how many Vine reviews there were. From the analysis below we can see there were 60 reviews from Vine members.
